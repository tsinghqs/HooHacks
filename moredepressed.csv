hate my life 
hate everything
want to die
wanna die
kms
cut myself
want to jump from a building
hope to get run over by a car
need help
wish my mental health was better
need to improve mood
need to improve mental health
need to improve well-being
wish i was not depressed
go to a therapist
good day to die
laid in bed all day
rarely happy
almost never happy
feel lethargic
#depressed
numb at this point
#suicidal
dark and lonely
fuck my life
sad mood
feeling down
feel broken
miserable failure
such a failure
