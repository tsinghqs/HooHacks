hate my life 
hate everything
want to die
cut myself
i want to jump from a building
i hope to get run over by a car
i need help
wish my mental health was better
need to improve mood
need to improve mental health
need to improve well-being
wish i was not depressed
go to a therapist
good day to die
laid in bed all day
rarely happy
almost never happy
feel lethargic
